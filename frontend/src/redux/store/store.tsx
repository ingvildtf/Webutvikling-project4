//STORE - globalized state, holds all the data and state for the application
//ACTION - describes what you want to do
//REDUCER - describes how your action transform your state into the next state, check which action you did, and based on the action the reducer are going to modifie the store
//DISPATCH - execute the action to the reducer. Say dispatch this action to the reducer, the reducer will check what to do and the store gets updated

//ReturnType grabs the return type of whats in the parameter
export type AppState = ReturnType<typeof rootReducer>

//initialiserer global store til Ã¥ inneholde de forskjellige reducerne

  rootReducer,
